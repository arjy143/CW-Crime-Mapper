    <h1>User Guide</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the crime mapper tool! In this guide
    I will be explaining the features of this app and how
    to use it.
    </p>
    <h3><u>Start - MapsActivity</u></h3>
    <p>Upon starting the app for the first time, you will be asked to give
    location and notification permissions. Without these the app will not work.
    After this, you will need to reload the app.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After the app has been set up for the first time, upon accessing the app
    for the second time, map markers will now appear. The red marker indicates
    the current user location or default location. The orange markers indicate
    where a crime has happened.</p>
    <div class = "img">
    <img src="file:///android_asset/MapsActivity.png"/>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>If you tap a marker, an info window will appear, showing some basic
    details about what happened there. If you hold down the marker, the
    app will take you to the InfoActivity, where you can see more details
    about that event.</p>
    <div class = "img">
    <img src="file:///android_asset/MapsActivityTap.png"/>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>There is a settings button on the top left corner of the app, which will
    take you to the settings page.</p>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Info - InfoActivity</u></h3>
    <p>The InfoActivity is where a user can see more details about the crime
    that they have tapped on. You are able to see the type of crime, the
        approximate location of the crime as well as the exact latitude
    and longitude co-ordinates.</p>
    <div class = "img">
    <img src="file:///android_asset/InfoActivity.png"/>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Settings - SettingsActivity</u></h3>
    <p>Tapping the settings button on the MapsActivity will take you to the
    SettingsActivity. This is where a user can be taken to the user guide, the
    data API or refresh the page.</p>
    <div class = "img">
    <img src="file:///android_asset/SettingsActivity.png"/>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>API button - This takes you to the UK police API, where you can see the
    documentation for accessing the various data records stored there.</p>
    <div class = "img">
    <img src="file:///android_asset/APIButton.png"/>
    </div>
    <br>
    <p>Refresh button - This activates an alarm which sends a broadcast, causing
    the app to refresh.</p>
    <div class = "img">
    <img src="file:///android_asset/Refresh.png"/>
    </div>
    <br>
    <h3><u>Notifications</u></h3>
    <p>A notification will appear upon starting the app. This notification will
    contain the current location of the user and the area that the crimes are being
    shown in.</p>
